# Tremor Detection

This project was my final project for my real time embedded systems class at NYU Tandon.

The goal is to detect and visualize intensity of tremors.

The device used was a STM32F429I-DISC1. The termors were detected using the integrated gyroscope. 

The project was built using Platform IO via VSCode.
