# Tremor Detection

This was my final group project for my real-time embedded systems class at NYU Tandon.

The goal is to detect and visualize the intensity of tremors.

The device used was an STM32F429I-DISC1. The tremors were detected using the integrated gyroscope. 

The project was built using Platform IO via VSCode.
